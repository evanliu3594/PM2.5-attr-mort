# $PM_{2.5}-attr-mort$

In the new released version of $PM_{2.5}-Attr-Mort$ incorporated both GEMM and IER modle in calculating the $PM_{2.5}$ health burden, by refering to different concentration-responce lookup-table.

I made the calculation process generalized to be able to adopt to any attributable death estimations by applying population table, incidence table, concentration table and the concentration-correspondingly relative risk lookup table together.

Before use the code, please prepear the input data as the same structure as the samples. And I recommend to use these code scripts in Rstudio for better convenience.
