# Genre
This project records my up-to-date progress in assessing the PM<sub>2.5</sub> health burden according to PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollutions across China. Theortically it is also appliable for other regions. P.S.: the **PM2.5-attr-mort** refers to the **PM<sub>2.5</sub>-attributable-mortality**

# Usage

1. Clone the repo and open it

2. Replace the sample data with your costomised ones: **!!Attention: Keep data structure!!**

    - for China estimation, you'll need to costomise:
        - the `FID_information`, which specifies the coordinations and geophysical information of each grid
        - the `Grid_PM.csv` specifies PM concentrations in years(by column) of each grid
        - and the `Grid_Pop.csv`specifies population size in years(by column) of each grids 

    - for other regions, additionally costomise:
        - the age structure data    
        - the mortality rate data
    - Note that all filenames shall be specified later in the `DataLoad` section in the `HealthBurdenCalc.R`.


3. Open the `PM25-attr-mort.Rproj` file in Rstudio.

4. Open `HealthBurdenCalc.R`, Specify filenames in the `Data Load` section if data is costomised.

5. Run codes in `HealthBurdenCalc.R` by rows.

# Changelog

## 1.0-release 

the Initial publish version of the PM25-attr-mort with a series of refined and easy-to-use functions to assess PM<sub>2.5</sub> health burden using the IER model.

## 2.0-release

PM<sub>2.5</sub>-Attr-Mort v2.0 incorporated both GEMM and IER model in calculating the PM<sub>2.5</sub> health burden, by refering to different concentration-responce lookup-table.

## 3.0-release

PM<sub>2.5</sub>-Attr-Mort v3.0 flushes the original linear algebra calculation by a more tidyr and database based syntax, which greatly improves the extensible for the scales of the model. 

## 4.0-doing

PM<sub>2.5</sub>-Attr-Mort v4.0 will be attached with fullly potential of easy extention and incorporation of multi-scale of input data. Which means this calculation model are finally capabale of community, urban, regional, national and global scale calculations - with just specify the scale of your data- and calculation will be done.
# Developer note
I made the calculation process generalized to be able to adopt to any attributable death estimations by applying population table, incidence table, concentration table and the concentration-correspondingly relative risk lookup table together.
