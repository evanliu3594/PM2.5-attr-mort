# PM2.5-attr-mort

This page is used to share the latest progress that I have made to calculate PM2.5 attributed mortality in China.

progr was devided into 2 part: Calculation of Relative Risk and Calculation of PM2.5 attributed mortality.

Calculation of Relative Risk was designed to calculate RR value under each concentration of PM2.5 based on 1000 parameters given by Intergrated Exposure-Responce model.

Calculation of PM2.5 attributed mortality is to use the output of Calculation of Relative Risk together with gridded population and PM2.5 concentration and multi-scale baseline incidence rate(national at present) to calculate attributed mortality in different scaled grid.
